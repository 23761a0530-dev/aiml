# 💳 Credit Card Approval Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Credit Card Approval Prediction** project is a Machine Learning-based web application that predicts whether a credit card application is likely to be **Approved** or **Rejected** based on an applicant's financial and demographic information.

The system automates the credit card approval process, reducing manual effort and enabling faster decision-making for banks and financial institutions. It combines machine learning techniques with a Flask web application to provide real-time predictions through an interactive user interface.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

### Programming Language
- Python

### Machine Learning
- Scikit-learn
- Joblib

### Data Analysis
- Pandas
- NumPy

### Visualization
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

### Web Development
- Flask

## 📂 Dataset

The project uses two CSV files:

- `application_record.csv`
- `credit_record.csv`

These datasets contain applicant demographic information and historical credit payment records that are merged and processed before training the machine learning models.

---

## 📊 Machine Learning Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Collection

- Load applicant dataset
- Load credit history dataset

---

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed:

- Dataset inspection
- Shape analysis
- Missing value analysis
- Feature exploration

---

### 3️⃣ Univariate Analysis

- Occupation distribution
- Count plots
- Category frequency analysis

---

### 4️⃣ Multivariate Analysis

- Correlation Heatmap
- Feature relationships

---

### 5️⃣ Descriptive Analysis

Generated statistical summaries using:

- Mean
- Standard deviation
- Minimum
- Maximum
- Percentiles

---

### 6️⃣ Data Preprocessing

Performed:

- Duplicate removal
- Missing value handling
- Dataset merging
- Feature engineering
- Label Encoding

---

### 7️⃣ Machine Learning Models

The following models were trained and evaluated:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier

---

### 8️⃣ Model Evaluation

Models were compared using:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix

The best-performing model was saved as:

```text
credit_card_model.pkl
```
